RevealCategories
================

Plugin for Vanilla forums that helps with a small inconsistency in Vanilla 2.1

"Hide from the recent discussions page" setting for categories also hides categories at other pages, too. This plugin restricts hiding to Recent Discussions and reveals categories elsewhere.
